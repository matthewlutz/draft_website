## Fernando Mendoza
Indiana, 6'5 225, 22 Y/O

### Pros
- mature
- leader
- Pretty good accuracy
- Good deep ball
- Good throwing towards the boundary
- 8 TD to 5 incompletions so far in the CFBP
- good enough mobility
- Great backshoulder and fade throw
- Good straight-line speed
- Great timing on layered throws

### Cons
- Arm talent is good enough, but it won't blow you away
- Almost EVERYTHING at Indiana was a RPO, play-action, or designed short pass
- Indiana runs a ton of RPO's not very translatable to the NFL
- Not accustomed to playing under center
- First/Second read qb
- Gets happy feet when pressure is coming
- Not good at avoiding sacks, needs to throw the ball away more(very evident in B1G Championship)
- Weak arm can be seen in first Oregon game where he throws a pick-6 on an underthrown ball due to pressure
