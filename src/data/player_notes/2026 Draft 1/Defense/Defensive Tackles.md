## Peter Woods
Clemson, 3 year starter, 6'3 315, 20 Y/O. 4.86 40

### Pros
- EXTREMELY explosive  
- Very fluid as an athlete  
- Violent heavy hands  
- Great at anchoring and shedding  
- Wins in both run defense and pass rush  
- Refined pass rush arsenal  
- Rare combination of power and speed for a DT  
- So explosive Clemson plays him on the edge sometimes 
- Scheme versatility (can play in a 3-4 DE/DT or 4-3 DT)  
- Can make plays in the open field due to how athletic he is

### Cons
- Sack production 
- Not the tallest at 6’3 (personally I don’t think this matters much)  
- Not the greatest tackler (18% missed tackle rate in 2025) 
- Shorter length/frame

## Lee Hunter
6'4 330, 23 Y/O

### Pros
- Incredible size
- Good first step for his size
- Really good lateral quickness makes zone runs ineffective towards his side
- Good against the run and pass
- Plays with VIOLENT hands and has great anchoring strength, stifling runs at the point of attack
- 3 years of good production
- 11.9% run-stop rate. Second in the entire country only behind first rounder Kayden McDonald
- 10.6% PRWR, 3rd in the country for DT

- 2.9% missed tackle rate against the run
### Cons
- Has a limited pass rush arsenal. He tends to only win with a bull rush or swipe.
- Motor is inconsistent. There are too many plays where it looks like he isn't trying if the ball isn't going his way. Will need better conditioning at the next level.
- Plays with inconsistent pad level and has a stiff lower half
- Will be 24 years old by the time of his first NFL snap
